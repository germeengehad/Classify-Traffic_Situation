# classification traffic conditions 
  ![credit card Image](https://github.com/germeengehad/classify-traffic-conditions/blob/main/6384213.546c472d8d7e4.png)

- This project aims to classify traffic conditions as low, normal, high, or heavy using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), decision trees, random forest, and gradient boosting with XGBoost.
- I plan to conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on my dataset, followed by data preprocessing and then building the models.
  
  # The Data Set
  ![credit card Image]()
  - The dataset is stored in a CSV file format on this repo (above)
  - This dataset contains traffic data with the following columns:
    - Time: The specific time of the traffic observation.
    - Date: The date of the traffic observation.
    - Day of the Week: The day of the week when the data was recorded.
    - CarCount: The number of cars counted during the observation period.
    - BikeCount: The number of bikes counted during the observation period.
    - BusCount: The number of buses counted during the observation period.
    - TruckCount: The number of trucks counted during the observation period.
    - Total: The total count of all vehicles (cars, bikes, buses, and trucks) during the observation period.

    # EDA And Data Preprossing
    - I discovred the data
    - I Encodeing the target encoding
    - i handling the missing values
    - i handlieng the multiconarrity
